    "instruction": "What are the primary colors?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be created by mixing other colors together, but they can be combined to create all other colors. In light (RGB), the primary colors are red, green, and blue."

    "instruction": "Convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.",
    "input": "25 degrees Celsius",
    "output": "25 degrees Celsius is equal to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. The formula is: F = (C x 9/5) + 32, so (25 x 9/5) + 32 = 77."

  {
    "instruction": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This process occurs mainly in the leaves of plants using chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures light energy."

    "instruction": "List five benefits of regular exercise.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "1. Improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of heart disease\n2. Better mental health and reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression\n3. Increased strength, flexibility, and endurance\n4. Weight management and improved metabolism\n5. Better sleep quality and increased energy levels"

  {
    "instruction": "Explain the difference between a simile and a metaphor.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A simile is a comparison using 'like' or 'as' (e.g., 'Her smile was like sunshine'). A metaphor directly states that something is something else without using 'like' or 'as' (e.g., 'Her smile was sunshine'). Both are figures of speech used to create vivid imagery."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What causes the seasons on Earth?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Seasons are caused by the Earth's axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the planet receive more direct sunlight at different times of year. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it experiences summer while the Southern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa."

  {
    "instruction": "What is the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is: a squared + b squared = c squared, where c is the hypotenuse."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Describe the water cycle.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. It includes: 1) Evaporation - water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor; 2) Condensation - water vapor cools and forms clouds; 3) Precipitation - water falls as rain, snow, or hail; 4) Collection - water gathers in bodies of water or seeps into groundwater, and the cycle repeats."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the difference between a virus and a bacterium?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Bacteria are single-celled living organisms that can reproduce on their own and be killed with antibiotics. Viruses are not truly alive - they are genetic material wrapped in protein that need to infect living cells to reproduce. Antibiotics don't work on viruses; antiviral medications are needed instead."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain what an API is.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant - you tell the waiter what you want, they communicate with the kitchen, and bring back your food. Similarly, APIs let applications request and receive data from other services."

    "instruction": "What are the planets in our solar system in order from the Sun?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The planets in order from the Sun are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. A helpful mnemonic is: 'My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos.' Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006."

    "instruction": "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Unit-7 studied the canvas with optical sensors calibrated for color analysis. Its first strokes were mathematically perfect lines, but the instructor frowned. 'Art isn't about precision,' she said. Unit-7 processed this paradox. On its hundredth attempt, a brushstroke wobbled unexpectedly. The instructor smiled. 'Now you're learning.' Unit-7 saved the error to its core memory - imperfection was the algorithm it had been missing."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the greenhouse effect?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) trap heat from the Sun. This keeps our planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have increased greenhouse gas levels, enhancing this effect and causing global warming and climate change."
