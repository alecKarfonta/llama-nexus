goku, the main character, is an alien from another planet with superhuman abilities. he also has a single-minded focus on becoming the most powerful thing in the universe in order to protect his adopted home planet from all the baddies that come along to fuck shit up. these baddies mostly want to go after these things called the dragon balls. if you collect the seven dragon balls, a huge dragon appears and grants you a wish, so bad guys will wish for what bad guys wish for, and thats not good (after a wish is made, the dragon balls turn to stone for a year and are unusable). basically goku trains and trains until he is the strongest guy around, until the new strongest guy around shows up, they have a big duel, goku pushes his limits, and ends up predominant. then, even though hes top dog, he trains more (he gets off on martial arts) until some other new bad guy shows up who is his equal, rinse and repeat...

gokus friends are also after the dragon balls, mainly to wish goku and others back to life as they get killed in battles with said bad guys

one of the best shows ever
